# Simple Express Server (SES)

## What?
Simple Express Server is exactly what it is is; a simple web server (that runs locally) built using the express web framework. It's a server that provides CRUD operations for testing purposes when I'm working on the frontend of some other app

## Why?
I know there are other options like using some dummy json data via a remote API but I want something that runs locally and which I have total control of, so that I can make customizations later on.

## Getting Started
- clone the repo
- run `npm i`
- run `npm run dev` to start the development server
